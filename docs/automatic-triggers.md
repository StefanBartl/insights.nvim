# Automatic triggers

Most of the plugin only acts when you ask it to. These four also run on their
own, and each is switched off with its `enable` key:

| Feature | Fires on | Does |
|---------|----------|------|
| `conflicts` | `VimEnter` | Quickfix-lists unresolved merge conflicts. Silent when the repo is clean or not a git repo. |
| `unimported` | `BufWritePost` | Warns about used-but-unimported components, for `unimported.filetypes` only. Silent when nothing is missing. |
| `devserver` | `TermOpen`, `TermRequest`, `VimLeavePre` | Detects dev servers and kills the ones you approved on exit. |
| `todos.highlight` | `BufWinEnter`, `FileType`, `TextChanged`, `TextChangedI`, `WinScrolled` | Colours annotation keywords (`TODO`, `FIX`, …) in the lines on screen and puts their icon in the sign column. Never notifies. |

## How the annotation highlight works

Only the lines a window is showing, plus a margin, are scanned — a change or
a scroll re-scans them (a change debounced by `todos.highlight.debounce_ms`, a
scroll at once), and extmarks outside the range are dropped and come back
when scrolled to. That is what keeps a very long file from paying for
annotations it never displays. Buffers with a `buftype`, a filetype in
`todos.highlight.exclude_filetypes` or a file larger than
`todos.highlight.max_file_size_kb` are left alone.

A keyword only counts inside a comment (`todos.highlight.comments_only`).
Tree-sitter answers that where the buffer has a parser — without needing
Tree-sitter *highlighting* to be on — and the syntax stack answers where it
does not. A buffer with neither keeps the match: plain text has no comments
to be outside of.

The highlight groups (`InsightsTodoFg<Category>`, `InsightsTodoBg<Category>`,
`InsightsTodoSign<Category>`, one set per `todos.colors` entry) are derived
from the active theme and redefined after every `:colorscheme` or
`&background` change through `lib.nvim.ui.hl.persist`, so a theme switch
never leaves them pointing at colours that no longer exist.

## How the dev-server tracking works

When a terminal command matches one of `devserver.patterns` (`npm run dev`,
`astro dev`, `vite`, …), a prompt asks once whether that server should be
killed when Neovim exits. Answer yes and its process tree is killed on
`VimLeavePre`; answer no (or press `<Esc>`) and it is left alone. You are asked
once per terminal — the answer sticks for that terminal's lifetime.

**Only terminals this Neovim instance started are tracked.** The kill targets
that terminal's recorded PID — its process tree via `taskkill /T` on Windows,
its process group via `kill -TERM -<pid>` elsewhere. A server you started in
another shell or a tmux pane is never touched, because this plugin only kills
processes it can account for. That is the deliberate trade-off against a
`pkill -f "astro dev"`-style sweep, which would also kill servers that have
nothing to do with this editor session.

A command typed into an already-open shell is only detected if the program sets
the terminal title (most dev servers do, via OSC 0/2). Starting the server as
the terminal's command — `:terminal npm run dev` — always works.

To skip the prompt and always kill matching servers:

```lua
devserver = { prompt = false, kill_on_exit = true }
```
